# Visualizing Earnings based on College Majors
## by Carol Obura
The focus of this project is data visualization. The dataset, released by the American community survey and cleaned by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) on github, records outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.

We use the following visualizations to explore questions from the dataset:
- Scatter plots - Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- Histograms - Which majors are predominantly male and female?
- Bar plots - What category of majors have the most students?

## Summary of Findings

The number of Men and Women with Business majors are relatively the same.

Majors such as Engineering, Computers and Mathematics have higher number of Men, this is probably due to the existing notion that such courses are meant for Men. However, majors such as Health and Arts have higher number of Women compared to men.

Generally, plots make it easier to draw comparisons and useful insights from data.
